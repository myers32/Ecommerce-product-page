### What I learned

I figured out how to access and change the .svg image color in CSS.

```css
  path {
    stroke: var(--softred);
  }
```

I used keyframes for creating animation when fading in text at faqs section.

```css
@keyframes fade {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(u.rem(-10));
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

I learned forEach loop and used it to aim all accordion items and add some listener on click.

```js
  const accordion = () => {
    const faqs = document.querySelectorAll(".faqs__accordion--item");

    faqs.forEach(faq => {
      faq.addEventListener("click", () => {
        faq.classList.toggle("active");
      });
    });
  };
```

I learned creating one function that initialize my all needed functions at once.

```js
  const init = () => {
    menu();
    changeUnderline();
    changeDisplay();
    accordion();
  };
```

### Continued development
In the future I want to focus on learing how to create more advanced animations.
Also I want to upgrade my knowledge in JS from beginner to more advanced.
